Wave Plumbing & Bathrooms ltd, previously known as Wave Plumbing, are a Brighton-based plumbing company that has grown from just their founder working as a plumber to a company employing multiple plumbers, managers, and administrators. Their growth has been amazing to see.

We initially branded, designed, and built their website for their founder back when he was just starting out. The initial brief was discussed over a cup of tea and the resulting logo became the cornerstone of the website's look and feel.

**Client Insight:**
Wave Plumbing & Bathrooms, a Sussex-based plumbing company, has grown from a one-man operation to a thriving business with multiple employees. They needed a brand and website that could keep pace with their expanding vision.

**Project Objectives:**
- Rebrand to reflect their evolution from a small plumbing service to a high-end bathroom and commercial operation.
- Design a new logo that maintains a nod to their roots while embracing a more sophisticated look.
- Develop a website that supports their new brand identity and enhances user experience.

**Our Creative Approach:**
1. **Brand Evolution:**
   - **Logo Redesign:** Inspired by The Great Wave off Kanagawa and surf brand aesthetics, we crafted a logo that combines elegance with a touch of nostalgia. The single-color vector graphic is versatile, ensuring it looks great across various applications.
   - **Modern Font Choice:** Coupled with a contemporary font, the new logo helps propel the brand into its next chapter.

2. **Website Redesign:**
   - **Enhanced Content & Imagery:** The new site features improved content, imagery, and video, offering a richer user experience.
   - **Performance & Accessibility:** Built to offer improved page speed and accessibility, the site ensures a seamless experience for all users.

**Outcome:**
Wave Plumbing & Bathrooms now boasts a brand and website that truly reflect their growth and aspirations. The new identity is classy and modern, ready to support their journey into high-end markets. Keep an eye out for their logo on vans and signs around Sussex — it’s a wave worth catching!
