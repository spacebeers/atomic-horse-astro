                    <p> It’s very easy to sign up. You choose the package you need, or <a href="/contact-us">contact us</a> to help you choose. We’ll then keep an eye on your site’s security, carry out back ups, provide reports and audits and, depending on the plan, provide monthly reports, strategic consultancy, site feature additions, etc.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-1 fw-normal">Is there a contract for any of the support plans?</h3>
                    <p>Nope. All we need is 30 days notice to cancel a support package and then it's over. We work on a rolling contact basis one month at a time.</p>

                <div class="faq">
                    <h3 class="text-1 fw-normal">What do the reports involve?</h3>
                    <p>Depending on the package the reports can be anything from any work that's occurred during the dedicated hours, any issues found or improvements needed. Tell us what's useful and we'll structure the reports accordingly.</p>

                <div class="faq">

                    <p>Within reason. We prefer to <a href="/services/development">support sites we’ve built</a> but are happy to take over other websites too. There may be an extra fee while we review the existing site.</p>
