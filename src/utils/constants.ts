      question: "Why choose Atomic Horse for WordPress hosting?",
      answer: "We're not just another web host — we're a creative, UK-based partner who looks after your site like it's our own. We host only one site per client to ensure high-quality, tailored support. From plugin troubleshooting to speed optimisation, we're here to keep your site secure, fast, and stress-free."
    },
    {
      question: "How does the WordPress hosting and support plan work?",
      answer: "Choose the plan that suits your business, or reach out for guidance. Once you're onboard, we’ll take care of everything: hosting setup, backups, updates, and performance tuning. We monitor your site and proactively maintain it based on your selected plan — monthly, weekly, or as needed."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I have to sign a long-term contract?",
      answer: "Nope. All plans are month-to-month or annual — whichever you prefer. Cancel any time with 30 days' notice. No lock-ins, no hassle."
    },
    {
      question: "What’s included in the reports?",
      answer: "Reports vary by plan, but typically include updates performed, backup logs, security scans, performance metrics, and any issues found or improvements made. We’ll shape your reports to be genuinely useful to you."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I get extra help beyond my plan?",
      answer: "Absolutely. While each package includes a set number of support hours, you can always request additional work such as SEO tweaks, analytics setup, custom features, or deeper technical audits."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I customise my hosting and support plan?",
      answer: "Yes. If your business has unique needs, we can create a bespoke WordPress care package just for you. We’ll review your site and provide a tailored solution."
    },
    {
      question: "Will you support a site you didn’t build?",
      answer: "Yes — within reason. While we love supporting sites we’ve developed ourselves, we're happy to take on existing WordPress websites too. There may be an initial audit fee to review the site before onboarding."
    },
    {
      question: "What do I need to do once I sign up?",
      answer: "Nothing — we’ve got it from here. Once your plan is confirmed, we handle the migration (if needed), start monitoring, and keep everything running smoothly behind the scenes so you can focus on your business."
