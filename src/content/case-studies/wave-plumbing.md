Wave Plumbing & Bathrooms ltd, previously known as Wave Plumbing are a Brighton based plumbing company that has grown from just their founder working as a plumber to a company employing multiple plumbers, managers and administrators. Their growth has been amazing to see. 

We initially branded, designed and built their website for their founder back when he was just starting out. The initial brief was discussed over a cup of tea and the resulting logo became the cornerstone of the website's look and feel.
