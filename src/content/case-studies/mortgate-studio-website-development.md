Mortgage Studio, a forward-thinking mortgage advisory service, needed a website that could not only showcase their expertise but also adapt to the ever-evolving digital landscape. They turned to us for a solution that was both stylish and functional.

**Project Goals:**
- Implement a custom, responsive WordPress theme that reflects their brand's professionalism and innovation.
- Transition from the classic WordPress editor to the new Block Editor, enhancing design flexibility.
- Provide ongoing support for feature updates, bug fixes, and SEO improvements.

**Our Creative Process:**
1. **Design & Development:**
   - **Collaborative Design:** We teamed up with our friends at Studio Polpetto to bring a beautiful design to life. The focus was on creating a clean, modern look that aligns with Mortgage Studio's brand values.
   - **Custom Theme Build:** Using WordPress and ACF, we crafted a fully responsive custom theme. This setup ensures the site looks great on any device and allows for easy updates and maintenance.
   - **Major Overhauls:** Throughout its lifetime, the site has undergone two significant refits, including a seamless transition to the WordPress Block Editor and major design and performance updates.

2. **Support & Maintenance:**
   - **Comprehensive Support:** We track all levels of website support through a Trello board, handling everything from new features to bug fixes and SEO support. This ensures Mortgage Studio's site remains in peak condition.

**Outcome:**
The Mortgage Studio website now stands as a testament to adaptability and style, providing a robust platform for their services. Our ongoing support ensures that the site continues to evolve with the client's needs, maintaining its competitive edge in the digital space.
