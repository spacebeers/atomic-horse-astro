Branding your own company can be a unique challenge, but at Atomic Horse, we embraced it as an opportunity to reflect our values and vision. Our mission was to create a brand identity that resonates across all touchpoints.

**Goals:**
- Develop a cohesive brand identity, starting with a logo that embodies our ethos.
- Design a website that showcases our work and highlights our wonderful clients.
- Ensure the site is as performant as possible, using the latest technology.

**Our Creative Exploration:**
1. **Brand Identity:**
   - **Logo Design:** We started with a simple, single-color vector logo that can be used across all brand materials. This approach ensures consistency and versatility, allowing the logo to shine on everything from business cards to digital screens.
   - **Typography & Colors:** Our new brand font, Red Hat Display, pairs beautifully with our logo, creating a modern and cohesive look.

2. **Website Design & Development:**
   - **Performance Focus:** Designed to work seamlessly in light or dark mode, our site uses vectors instead of bitmap images to enhance performance. This ensures fast load times and a smooth user experience.
   - **Reusable Components:** The site is built using AstroJS and markdown files, allowing us to compose pages effortlessly and highlight our clients and services.

**Outcome:**
Our branding and website now reflect who we are and what we stand for â€” a digital agency committed to making a difference. The new identity is not just about looking good; it's about embodying our core value of being useful.
